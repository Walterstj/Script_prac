Arithmetic Expressions
Below are the operators supported by bash for mathematical calculations:

OPERATOR	USAGE
+	addition
-	subtraction
*	multiplication
/	division
**	exponentiation
%	modulus

Numeric Comparison logical operators
Comparison is used to check if statements evaluate to true or false. We can use the below shown operators to compare two statements:

OPERATION	        	SYNTAX			EXPLANATION
Equality			num1 -eq num2		is num1 equal to num2
Greater than equal to		num1 -ge num2		is num1 greater than equal to num2
Greater than			num1 -gt num2		is num1 greater than num2
Less than equal to		num1 -le num2		is num1 less than equal to num2
Less than			num1 -lt num2		is num1 less than num2
Not Equal to			num1 -ne num2		is num1 not equal to num2

Conditional Statements (Decision Making)
Conditions are expressions that evaluate to a boolean expression (true or false). To check conditions, we can use if, if-else, if-elif-else and nested conditionals.

The structure of conditional statements is as follows:

if...then...fi statements
if...then...else...fi statements
if..elif..else..fi
if..then..else..if..then..fi..fi.. (Nested Conditionals)

Looping and skipping
For loops allow you to execute statements a specific number of times.

While loop
While loops check for a condition and loop until the condition remains true. We need to provide a counter statement that increments the counter to control loop execution.
